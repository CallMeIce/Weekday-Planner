# Weekday-Planner

## Description

My motivation for this project was to build a planner that would help people plan there day out. I built this so that people had an easier time remembering what they would have to do between the hours of 9am and 5pm.
This solves people not having to buy an actual planner and having a mobile planner on the go. I learned a lot more of JQuery and how to use bootstrap/moment more.

## Installation

All you have to do is just load in from the URL, type the text in any of the middle boxes.

## Usage

Add your text inbetween the time and the save button to remember your event for that hour.
